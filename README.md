# Zini

Zini is the task tracker part of the Subsequent ecosystem. This is the core tasking engine used to store tasks for agents and people alike.

## Events

Zini sends events about changes to the task system over [Prism](https://github.com/kraemahz/prism). This ties its updates into the ecosystem and allows driving agent behavior off changes to tasks.

## Frontend

There is currently no frontend for Zini, this will change in the future.
